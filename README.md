# ❤️ LifeLink – Blood & Organ Donor Search Platform

## 🏁 Project Goal

**LifeLink** is a life-saving web application built to **connect people in urgent need of blood or organ donations** with potential **local donors** and **hospitals**. The platform enables users to search for blood types or specific organs and find verified donors or nearby hospitals with availability.

When someone needs help and cannot find a donor or hospital manually, **LifeLink automates the search process**, contacts potential matches, and shares verified contact details once a donor agrees to help — streamlining the life-saving process.

## ✨ Features

- 🩸 **Search for Blood Donors** – Users can search by **blood group and location**. The system finds and notifies registered users willing to donate that match the criteria.

- 🏥 **Organ Availability (Nearby Hospitals)** – Users searching for an organ (e.g., kidney, liver) can view **nearby hospitals** where availability is registered and request further contact.

- 📍 **Location-Based Matching** – Matches are filtered based on the **user’s city or region**, ensuring proximity and increasing chances of real help.

- 🤝 **Secure Information Sharing** – Donor or hospital information is only shared **after consent**, protecting privacy and promoting ethical data handling.

- 🆓 **Free for All Users** – LifeLink is free to use and open to all users needing or offering help.
